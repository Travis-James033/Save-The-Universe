Save The Universe
SBA 308H Project

"Save The Universe" is a game where you control the USS Assembly and battle against an alien fleet to save the universe.

To play the game, click on the canvas to start. The game is played in rounds. Each round consists of the user attacking the alien spaceship followed by the 
alien spaceship attacking the user if it is still alive. 
The user's attack accuracy is determined by the spaceship's accuracy value. If the user's attack is successful, it will deal damage to the alien spaceship. 
The alien spaceship's attack accuracy is also determined by its accuracy value. 
If its attack is successful, it will deal damage to the user's spaceship. The game ends when the user's spaceship or the alien fleet is destroyed.

The user can also choose to retreat by clicking on the retreat button. This will end the game and display the end screen.

The user's spaceship has the following properties:

- Hull: Represents the spaceship's health. If it reaches 0, the user loses the game.
- Firepower: Represents the spaceship's attack power.
- Accuracy: Represents the spaceship's attack accuracy.

The alien fleet consists of 6 alien spaceships. Each alien spaceship has randomly generated hull, firepower, and accuracy values.

The user wins the game if they successfully defeat all 6 alien spaceships. The user loses the game if their spaceship's hull reaches 0.
